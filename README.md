# VirtualSimFactory
This project is a result of my work in production companies where I was developing tools to help simplify work. This repository is a summary of tools developed for a fictional Factory to show what is possible. The files within this repository are not copies of any of my previously developed tools but new ones with same principles as originals.

<p>The Factory has 2 Production Units. Unit 1 produces a few types chocolate cookies and Unit 2 produces custom designed boxes (with graphics). Such a scenario will allow me to show differences in design of data processes required for each type of production. </p>
