# simulated_factory
This project is a result of my work in a few production companies where I discovered I was comfortable with data and I was developing tools to help simplify work. This repository is a summary of tools developed for a fictional Factory to show what is possible.
<br>The Factory has 2 Production Units. Unit 1 produces a few types chocolate cookies and Unit 2 produces custom designed boxes (with graphics). Such a scenario will allow me to show differences in design of data processes required for each type of production.
